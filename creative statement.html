	<p> This is my creative statement <p>
<p>Katie Kuang,<p> 
When I think of art, I think brightness and colors.  My work portrays how I see the world as a bright and vibrant place.  This shows through my urge to take photos of the sky every time I go travelling.  I have lots of interest in gaining experience in photography, coding, and animations.  My views of the media, through many movies and dramas that I watch portray what I see and how I experience the world.  I find it fascinating how many people can tell a story through the film or the media portraying people’s inner thoughts and emotions without actually stating them.
