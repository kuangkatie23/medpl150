Hw#2- On Photography by Susan Sontag 
After reading “In Plato’s cave” from On Photography by Susan Sontag she makes a lot of good points on how photography is used in many different ways, both negatively and positively.  One thing she mentions people use photography for is “tourism” Susan Sontag claims that photography helps “people take possession of space in which they are insecure.”, and is used as a form of “tourism”.  She explains how it feels, "positively unnatural to travel for pleasure without taking a camera along.  Photographs will offer indisputable evidence that the trip was made, that the program was carried out, that fun was had.”(Sontag 2).  This idea of how people use photography for tourism applies to my life as well because whenever I go travelling with my family I have this urge to take a picture of every nice and random thing I see, and If I don’t take a picture of it, I would regret it later on in the day.  When my parents take me to a new place it’s always so nice to notice differences from where I live, that I have to take a picture. Some places are really colorful and pretty, it’s fun to see how the camera would capture that particular place.  Taking an image makes me feel happy and it gives me the feeling that the world is a big and bright place.  The use of photography for tourism also makes me feel the desire to travel when I’m currently in the school semester, and I see travel photos online or even advertisements.  Photography can also be used as a way of showing the world from one’s perspective.  Sometimes the choice in colors people use in an image is secretly and indirectly telling us a story.  Photography can also be used as a sense of self identification, because when I look at myself through an image it looks nothing like how I see myself in the mirror, and it gives me a sense of how I look to other people.  Photographs can also be used as a false reality, because it has been, “reduced, blown up, cropped, retouched, doctored, tricked out”.(Sontag 1).  This is true today because there are many edits created where people change the photo so much we can’t tell it apart from the original.  It becomes an illusion and creates a sort of fake reality because it’s hard to believe what is real and what isn’t.  Susan Sontag also brings up a point of how photographs are being constantly copied and reprinted that there are lots of replicas of famous images that takes away the desire to see the real one captured by an artist.  Susan Sontag also points out the negatives within photography, about how taking photographs should have limits because it makes people a “bystander”.  I agree with this statement because it still applies today.  We see it when fights break out at school or on the street and the first thing people think to do is instantly take out their phones to record what’s happening that they don’t realize or care that people are getting injured in the process.  I feel like this shows how there are many people out there who are very mean and only care about themselves.  When I was young I felt that taking pictures gives you the joy and pleasure of something you can’t have or keep, because when I really wanted something that my mom refused to buy for me, at the age of 8 or 10 she would tell me to take a picture of it, and that made me feel happy even though I did not actually own the object that I wanted, but I just had a photo of it for memory.  Now as I grow up I realized that photos hold a lot of value and meaning within them.
